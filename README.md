## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mira Welner, a Data Scientist and Programmer.
### I hope to get a PhD in applying machine learning and data science to biomedical research, and following that, continue to research in industry. Someday I'd like to go into low earth orbit or higher ðŸš€

### My Current Projects 
- Iâ€™m currently working for Professor Deeptankar DeMazumder in the [McGowan Institute of Regenerative Medicine](https://mirm-pitt.net/)
- On the side I am contracting for [Hermit Tech](https://www.hermit-tech.com/)
- Iâ€™m currently learning about (and interested in) <b>interpretation of ECG signals and other carardiovascular electronic records</b> and <b>Generative Adversarial Networks</b>

### My work in Computational Spectroscopy ðŸŒˆ
* [<i>Sparse Infrared Spectroscopy for Detection of Volatile Organic Compounds</i>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20678)
* Codebase will be published as soon as Sandia Labs lets me (soon I hope)

### My work in Computer Vision ðŸ‘€
* [<i>Unsupervised Identification of Materials with Hyperspectral Images</i>](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/21708)
* [Corresponding Slides](https://burningsilicon.dev/docs/rice_poster.pdf)
* [Corresponding Repository](https://github.com/MiraWelner/Unsupervised-Identification-of-Materials-with-Hyperspectral-Images-code)


### My work in Robotics ðŸ¤–
* [<i>Characterizing Pediatric Hand Grasps During Activities of Daily Living to Inform Robotic Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies
</i>](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36176073/)
